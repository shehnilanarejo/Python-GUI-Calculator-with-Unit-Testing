# Python-GUI-Calculator-with-Unit-Testing
This repository contains a Python Calculator application featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division. It also includes unit tests that assert the correctness of the mathematical operations.
Features
Basic Calculator Operations:

Add: Adds two numbers.
Subtract: Subtracts the second number from the first.
Multiply: Multiplies two numbers.
Divide: Divides the first number by the second, handling division by zero errors.

User-Friendly GUI:
Input fields for two numbers.
Buttons for each of the four basic arithmetic operations.
A result display that shows the calculated outcome.

Unit Testing:
Includes unit tests that validate the calculator's functionality, including edge cases like division by zero.
The tests ensure the correctness of each operation using assertions.

Requirements
Python (preferably version 3.x)
Tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
